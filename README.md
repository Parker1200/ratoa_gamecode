# Documentation

See the [documentation for players](https://ratmod.github.io).

## Running a server

Generally, the OpenArena documentation on how to run a server applies.
Check out additional settings in ratmod using `\cvarlist g_*` from the server console.

Some important/recommended settings are (incomplete list):

```
set sv_pure 1 // pure server, only allow clients to load pk3s also loaded on the server
set sv_fps 40 // ratmod is intended to be used with 40 server frames per second.
set pmove_float 1 // floating-point physics
set pmove_fixed 0

// sv_floodprotect may cause issues (chats not going through etc)
// you should use the g_flood* settings to limit flooding instead
set sv_floodProtect 0 

// enable hitscan delag
set g_delagHitscan 1
set g_lagLightning 0

// recommended:
set sv_timeout 60 // quick timeout
set sv_maxping 0 // may cause problems if set to any other value
set com_ansiColor 1 // colored console
set videoflags 0 // allow clients to use things like vertex light, picmip etc
```

Many of the mod settings listed are defaults already, but may have different defaults in OA itself. Be careful not to mix up configs from different games.

# Download

Ratmod releases are built automatically by Github Actions.
The latest releases of the mod be [downloaded from github.com](https://github.com/rdntcntrl/ratarena_release/releases).

## Installation

Simply put the `z-ratmod-v*.pk3` file into `~/.openarena/rat` (or `%APPDATA%\OpenArena\rat` on Windows) and you should be able to load the mod from the OA main menu. You can also launch directly into the mod with `openarena +set fs_game rat` from the command line (or adjust your desktop shortcut accordingly).

# Building

If you want to build ratmod from source, you should check out
the [ratarena_release repository](https://github.com/rdntcntrl/ratarena_release), which can be used to compile the gamecode and assets in a reproducible manner.

**Note:** Building Ratmod is only tested on Linux. It *might* work on BSDs, but will likely fail on Windows.

For developers, you can build the QVM + native code from this repository using:

```sh
make WITH_MULTITOURNAMENT=1 BUILD_GAME_QVM=1 BUILD_STANDALONE=1 BUILD_GAME_SO=1 BUILD_MISSIONPACK=0
```
